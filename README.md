- My project is based on Exploratory Data Analysis for a Dataset provided to us from a Fintech company . 
- The project is for a Fintech Company which provides online virtual loans for its customers. We are provided with all the past data of the company for analysing the dataset and findout the Fully paid customers and who as the defaulters . This helps the company in deciding to provide loan to the customer or not so as to avoid and financial loses to the company. 
- The Buisness problem which I have tried to solve using EDA is tp find out the attributes which decides wheather a customer fall under defaulter or not . By this analysis is it very useful for the company to decide to accept the customers application or not for the loan depending on these factors which has been analysed.
